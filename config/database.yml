# TODO:
# as long as you are using sqlite for development and test envs
# the default configs are not working correctly because default adapter is postgres
# to fix it you should specify postgres specifically for production env
# or you could leave postgres as default but then you'll need to repeat yourself and specify 
# sqlite twice for test and development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
